/**
 * This module defines the API endpoints for the application.
 * 
 * The endpoints are responsible for handling various HTTP requests
 * and providing appropriate responses. Each endpoint corresponds
 * to a specific route and performs a particular action, such as
 * retrieving data, creating new records, updating existing records,
 * or deleting records.
 * 
 * The endpoints are organized based on the resource they manage,
 * and they follow RESTful principles to ensure a consistent and
 * predictable API design.
 * 
 * Each endpoint includes appropriate error handling and validation
 * to ensure the API is robust and reliable.
